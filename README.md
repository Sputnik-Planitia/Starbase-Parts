# Starbase-Parts
This is a mod that gives you StarBase parts such as the High Bay, etc.

This mod is made by me, Sputnik Planitia.

I am a pretty inexperienced with modelling and modding in general, heck the High Bay
is in fact my first ever model.

Textures are reletavely simple with just basic solid colours for now.

Revamps will come in the future.
